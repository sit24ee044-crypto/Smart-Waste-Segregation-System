# Smart Automated Waste Segregation System

## Project Overview

This project proposes a smart scheme for a completely automated system of waste segregation by means of various detectors that execute image processing to effectively classify different types of waste. This can be performed with a system of clever classification through various actuators to execute physical waste segregation. This enables the reduction of manual labor, safe working conditions, better recycling efficiency, along with a reduced adverse effect on the environment. Hence, by including hardware automation along with software intelligence, this system presents a completely efficient means for better waste management.

## Problem Statement & Solution

Currently, most forms of waste segregation mechanisms utilize either manual workforce or single sensor-aided approaches whereby waste is divided into just a few basic types. However, such approaches are plagued by problems such as inaccuracy, lack of scalability, as well as inefficient management of mixed waste.

Our solution is distinct in that it utilizes the combination of multiple sensors with image-processing units in contrast to the application of a single device. Moreover, it utilizes intelligent classification in concert with physical separation units such as actuators and vibrator.

The system captures real-time images of waste and sensor data, process them through intelligent algorithms of classification, and automatically segregate the wastes into respective bins using actuators. This reduces human involvement, enhances accuracy in sorting, increases the recovery of reusable materials, and ensures a far safer and more hygienic operation of wastes. It will directly address the inefficiency, inaccuracy, and other worker safety issues in the current methods.

The key USP is the hybrid combination involving multi-sensor detection and image processing coupled with automated mechanical segregation, which is a smart and sustainable approach to achieving higher accuracy and reliability, handling larger volumes of material, and protecting people from exposure to the waste material itself.
